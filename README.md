Quiz app
===================
This app allows a user to create Quizzes, single answer questions, and multiple answer questions. Once the user has added their questions, they can then proceed to practice the 
quizzes they have created. If a user wishes to edit a quiz, or a question they can do this by using the update quiz or update SAQ/MCQ methods. Lastly, once they have finished 
with a quiz and wish to remove it, they can do so by the delete quiz method. This will remove the quiz and all the SAQ/MCQ associated with it.
