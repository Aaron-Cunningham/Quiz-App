Quiz app
===================
This app allows a user to create Quizzes, single answer questions, and multiple answer questions. Once the user has added their questions, they can then proceed to practice the 
quizzes they have created. If a user wishes to edit a quiz, or a question they can do this by using the update quiz or update SAQ/MCQ methods. Lastly, once they have finished 
with a quiz and wish to remove it, they can do so by the delete quiz method. This will remove the quiz and all the SAQ/MCQ associated with it.


Getting started with the Quiz App
====================================
1) Download the file by clicking ***code*** and ***download zip***.
2) Make sure all the requirements are installed/imported.
3) Navigate to the IO class and run the program from there (Press the green button).
4) Follow the onscreen instructions (From terminal).



Assumptions
===========
1) Answers can be written in either upper/lower case
2) When using a update, delete, and create methods, the CSV is updated along with the Database
3) When first running the IO the data is overwritten and updated within the databases from whatever is stored on the CSV files, this is a safety check in case of the database loosing data
4) The user is required to manually type in the answers when answering questions, or they can copy and paste the answer from terminal
5) When adding a MCQ, the program will ask you to input 4 answers, 2 of the answers will be wrong answers and the 1 will be the right one. On the final input you re type in the right answer.
